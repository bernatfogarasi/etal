# et al.

[etal.hu](https://www.etal.hu) is not my website. In this repo I just tried to recreate it to see if I can correct some of it's bugs.

## What is et al?

> ‘et al.’ = ‘and others’, abbr. < Latin et alii (m.), et aliae (f.), et alia (n.)
> Et al. — Critical Theory Online is an open access electronic volume series launched in 2013 by the Department of Comparative Literature at the University of Szeged, Hungary. We publish one or two volumes per year, at differing intervals, in co-operation with local or international research teams or individuals. Each volume is devoted to a specific theme, and comprises essays and sometimes even related review articles. Topics may traverse several disciplines from literary studies and language philosophy, through art and media theory, to the more general questions of technology, economy, and history. We enhance transdisciplinary critical investigations, and welcome guest editors. All contributors are committed to comparative analysis, in terms of history, language, and culture.
> Our series is bilingual. Volumes are either in English or Hungarian. Volumes in Hungarian are accessible at www.etal.hu.
> For a slightly different and somewhat longer formulation of our mission, see the series editor’s Intro.
